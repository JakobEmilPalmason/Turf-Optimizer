# Turf-Optimizer
Python tool that calculates the optimal roll layout for synthetic turf on arbitrary polygons. It minimizes waste, reports costs, provides a Pareto frontier, and exports PDF/GeoJSON summaries from a single event.json input. Built in collaboration with Reykjav√≠k University and Metatron, a leading artificial turf installer in Iceland.
